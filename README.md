## Team Communication
We have decided to use text messages to provide daily updates on how we are doing with our app. We are also using Teams and discord for communication. These two apps help us share screens and have live coding so that we can see our teammates' screens and give opinions about the code.

## Reflections
As a team, we all worked on our respective parts. Although at first, it was difficult for us to communicate and come to an agreement, in the end, we were able to align and achieve the goals we set. Additionally, dividing the work into smaller parts and consistently asking the team for help was something we all did. Even though none of us had knowledge of Kotlin at the start, we were all able to learn it and combine our knowledge to successfully deploy the application.
